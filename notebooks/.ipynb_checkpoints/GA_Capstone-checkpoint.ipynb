    "Principle is to build an email service app and flask web app that will deliver a daily email with 5 recommended articles based on what articles a person is interested in according to a machine learning algorithm. This will initally mean creating a model based on data pulled from pocket using the API. Laterly this will mean creating a service that will pull news from RSS feeds and testing them against the model to find top recommendations. Then creating a second service that will send out automatic emails with recommended articles."

This requires the use of scraping on a number of different web sources. This would be a time consuming process if I were to write a bespoke web scraper for each website. Therefore I decided to use an link embedding service with an api to query. Initially I tried to use embed.ly however this is now a very expensive paid service. I instead have used embed.rocks. This is tested below and applied to the whole list of article URLs from above. \n",
