    "During the 3 months I worked with NHS Digital and Joseph Connor I focussed on one particular problem within the NHS and in particular in finding a technological solution. The problem can be easily described in a single sentence.\n",

    "\n",
    "This may seem like a very basic function for any institution to carry out in order to validate the work that they do. However it has not been a priority for the NHS. I began the project looking at how other industries have solved this problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "An initial idea was to use a similar technology to the 'Happy or Not' bots. It was quickly decided that these would be highly impractical to install in every hospital, GP and other frontline NHS services. However a technological solution could be found which would operate in a similar way. \n"

It became clear after an extensive literature review that there is little to no follow up to NHS 111 calls. After a call has been made and a disposition reached by following the highly structured system for the call. \n",
    "\n",
    "A follow up to the call would be valuable for a number of reasons, the most important of which is that it would provide vital data to validate and potentially improve the service provided by the NHS for the 111 calls.\n",
