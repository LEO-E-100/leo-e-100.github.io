<div class="about">
  <h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>
  <p>I am a London based software devloper, currently working on a master's degree in Computer Science from University College London.</p>
  <p>My Undergraduate degree was in Biological Science at the University of Oxford. It was here that my passion for technology and software development really came about as data analysis was covered in some depth to assist students in carrying out experiments into biological cell function. Learning to code in R for data anaylysis was an eye opening experience and caused me to seek out more in the way of coding experience and data analysis projects.</p>
  <p>Over the following summer I taught myself to code in Python and began projects to learn Machine Learning techniques as well as the bread and butter tools of Python data analytics. This lead to my first full project which can be found under Google_ML.</p>
  <p>From here I gained a desire to formalise my training in Computer Science with a degree. I applied to UCL and here I am.</p>
  <p>My interests at the moment are largely in applying my knowledge of data and computer science into a data engineering or data science setting. In particular big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence and computational biology are my areas of interest and expertise.</p>
