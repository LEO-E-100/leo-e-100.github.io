          <a href="mailto:leojpedwards@gmail.com">leojpedwards@gmail.com</a>
        </div>
        <p class="mb-5">I am a London based data scientist, currently working on the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly London.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">I have a Master’s degree in Computer Science from UCL and an Undergraduate degree in Biological Science from Oxford University.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">It was at Oxford that my interest in technology and data science really evolved as data analysis was covered in some depth to facilitate experiments into biological cell function. Learning to code in R for data analysis was an eye-opening experience
          and caused me to seek out more in the way of coding experience and data analysis projects.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">Over the following summer I taught myself to code in Python and began projects to learn Machine Learning techniques as well as the bread and butter tools of Python data analytics.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">After finishing my Master’s I had a strong desire to delve deeper into data science and to really challenge myself to turn my hobby into a career. This led me to the Data Science Immersive course at General Assembly. There I gained the experience
          and knowledge to approach data problems in a structured way to gain the most valuable insights.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">My interests at the moment are largely in applying my knowledge of data and computer science into a data engineering or data science setting. In particular big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence and computational biology are my areas
          of interest and expertise.</p>
        <p class="mb-5">I have a passion for combining my background in biology, computer science and data science. In particular in healthcare analytics which I feel is a vital and fascinating area of research to which I hope to contribute in the future.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
        <p>Apart from my interests in Data Science I am a keen mountaineer, indoor climber, sailor and explorer. My love of the mountains began at a young age with skiing lessons and progressed when I began my mountaineering career in 2016. This was the
          culmination of 10 years of indoor climbing which, while great fun, led me to want more fresh air while climbing.</p>
        <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors I am a keen reader, mostly of the adventures of other climbers but also any sci-fi and fantasy novel that appeals to me. I also enjoy cooking the meals that I have tried around the world with a particular emphasis on the food
          of Spain.</p>

            <p>These are my thoughts after reading the book 'Fermat's Last Theory' by Simon Singh. The book was enormously interesting and really fueled a fire in me to explore a more in depth look at mathematical proof.</p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">'The Beckoning Silence' by Joe Simpson</div>
            <p>As a keen mountaineer I felt this book would appeal to me for the sense of adventure that it evoked. However as I read more the more it occurred to me how the lessons of the mountains could be applied to life more generally. Climbing has defined
              my personality in a big way by giving me a sense of perseverance, teamwork, constant challenge. These are qualities which I feel are encompassed not just in my climbing life but also my academic and soon my work life. I never back down from
              a challenge, whether a summit or a particularly complex technical problem. I seek out challenges as I find that is where I learn and improve. In the mountains teamwork is how a person survives, as a consequence I have developed strong collaborative
              skills.

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Quiver app</div>
            <p>Quiver is an app that allows for note taking and organising. This app has helped me to organise my life for over a year now. Before I would have loose pages of notes all over my floor in barely comprehensible chaos. Now Quiver takes care of
              it and since I downloaded it I haven’t missed a deadline or lost a note. I can now happily describe myself as a well organised person whereas before it was a significant weakness for me.</p>

            <div class="subheading mb-3">Run</div>
            <p>When I’m not coding I like to breathe the fresh air and run. I find it satisfying to experience the discipline that running requires, it helps my body and my mind to stay healthy. I like to compete against myself to see if I can be always
              improving. I also have found that the best way to solve a complex technical problem is to put on my running shoes and listen to a podcast unrelated to data or computing. This allows my subconscious to solve the problem (I call it productive
              laziness).
